    <h1>Our Concept</h1>
<div>
    <h2>Problem</h2>
    <p>Research is crucial for the career of any medical doctor. Medical students often struggle with starting their research journey due to a lack of cohesive learning resources and networking opportunities. There is no central place for students to learn why research is important or how to conduct it effectively, making the process socially and intellectually demanding. This gap highlights the need for a structured environment that provides both education and opportunities for collaboration with mentors and peers.
    </p>
    <h2>Our solution</h2>
